我的第一次作业

1.Computer

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. 

计算机是一种装置，它可以被指令通过计算机程序自动执行算术或逻辑运算序列。

2.Computer science

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.

计算机科学是对构成计算机设计和使用的基础的理论、实验和工程的研究。

3.Software

Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.

计算机软件，或简称软件，是一个通用术语，指的是一组数据或计算机指令，这些数据或计算机指令告诉计算机如何工作，这与实际执行工作的物理硬件形成对比。

4.Software engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

软件工程是工程应用于软件开发的一种系统方法。

5.Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality ,which was then considered a crime in the UK.

Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS(1912年6月23日—1954年6月7日)是英国计算机科学家、数学家、逻辑学家、密码分析家、哲学家和理论生物学家。图灵理论在计算机科学的发展中有很大影响，它用图灵机提供了算法和计算概念的形式化，图灵机可以被认为是通用计算机的模型。图灵被广泛认为是理论计算机科学和人工智能的父亲。然而，他也是一个悲剧人物：一个英雄，因为他的同性恋，在他有生之年在他的祖国从未被完全承认，这在当时被认为是在英国的犯罪。

6.Moore's Law

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

穆尔定律是在一个密集的集成电路中晶体管的数量大约每两年增长一倍的观察。
